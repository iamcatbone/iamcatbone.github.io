This is an iPad app designed for Prudential Limited Hong Kong for the purpose of internal training.

In the UI design of this app, these elements are adopted as well to give an impression of fresh to the users. Shadow is dropped for the cards and buttons to indicate they are on a different layer from the background and trigger the intuition of the users to click on them. The active option is in a darker colour to indicate itâ€™s the active state. For completed courses, a green tick appears at the bottom right corner to let users know which courses are completed at simply one glance.

The wireframe was given by the developer after confirming different functions in the app. I was responsible for the UI design. After that, the developers programmed the app.
