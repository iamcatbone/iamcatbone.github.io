## A Comic about Copyright

Every child understands that stealing goods from a shop is illegal. Hence, the editor had thought of a metaphor to tell the primary students that infringing copyright is like stealing the farmerâ€™s products that they enjoy the products without putting any effort. Then, I was responsible for visualising the story. I put the policeman at the last scene to emphasize that stealing is illegal because children tend to think policemen represents justice, and they will catch the bad guys.

## A Comic to Introduce Microsoft Word

It is a comic in chapter 1 of the textbook to introduce MS Word to the primary students. I was responsible for the content design of this textbook. I believe that it would be too boring for primary students to make it like a tool book simply showing different functions in a step-by-step manner. Therefore, I try to use a series of stories to introduce different functions in MS Word. This comic is about the two pupils found it difficult to memorize the vocabularies and Dr Lion suggests them to make the flashcards on their own with MS Word to make it more interesting.

For the later chapters, the students learn how to change the font size and font colour to make the flashcards colourful, learn how to add images into a Word document to complete the flashcards and learn to use the table to make the size of each flashcard the same.
