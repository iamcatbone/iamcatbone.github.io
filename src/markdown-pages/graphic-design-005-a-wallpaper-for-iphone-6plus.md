I have designed this wallpaper for my own use with the self-encouraging line “Just walk and you will be there” to tell myself to keep drawing and design. I believe one day my dream will come true. I use the footprint to represent the steps in the past. I made this wallpaper for my boyfriend and I. He likes goats and I like cats so these two types of animals were used in the wallpaper.
