This is also a supplementary mini-game for primary students. In the textbook, ‘computers’ are defined as machines that could process the input and generate different outputs. This is a game aimed to check if the students understand the concept thoroughly. Since many children like watching cartoons or dramas of different rangers defeating the monsters, I used this as the theme of the game to attract the students.

Students have to drag and drop the ‘computers’ in order to provide energy for the ranger to attack the monster. If wrong objects are dropped, the ranger will be attacked by the monster. students could win the game by identifying all the computers and the Hp value of the monster will be 0. On the contrary, when the Hp value of the ranger becomes 0, they lose the game.

The game was coded by a programmer while I was responsible for the mechanics, UI and graphic design of the game.
