This is also a supplementary mini-game for primary students to practise typing. This game is an advanced version that it recognises symbols and different letter cases. The editor suggested a background story of characters being controlled by the ghosts and the ghosts were bringing them away. We have to save them by attacking the ghosts with Taoist spells.

When the correct answer is input, Dr Lion can attack the corresponding ghosts with the Taoist spells and the characters controlled by ghosts will be saved. The ghosts will carry the characters from the left to the right of the window. If students are not able to input the correct answer before that, their HP value will be deducted. As more and more people are saved, their level will increase and the speed of the ghosts will increase as well. If the playersâ€™ input correct spells consecutively, they can get higher combos and a higher increase in score. After the game, score, statistics of speed and accuracy are revealed. The developer has also enabled skills on the left of the interface.

The game was coded by a programmer while I was responsible for the mechanics, UI and graphic design of the game.
