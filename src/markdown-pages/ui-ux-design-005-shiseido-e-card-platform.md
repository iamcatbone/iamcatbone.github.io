My company worked for Shiseido to build an e-card system for the internal greeting. My role was to work on the visual design part of the GIF e-cards and the UI design of the platform.


## GIF e-Card Design

â€˜Shiseido had requested for e-cards of the themes birthday, anniversary or all-purpose. They would like the cards to be coherent with their brand that Japanese style or cosmetic elements were used in the design of the e-cards.

I was responsible for the graphic design and creation of motion graphics with the use of Adobe Illustrator and After Effects.

    <img style="padding: 15px;" src="/ui-ux-design/005/media/ecard-001.gif" alt="e-card" width="30%">
    <img style="padding: 15px;" src="/ui-ux-design/005/media/ecard-002.gif" alt="e-card" width="30%">
    <img style="padding: 15px;" src="/ui-ux-design/005/media/ecard-003.gif" alt="e-card" width="30%">
</div>

## UI Design

Shiseido wished us to use the red colour on their corporate logo and stick to the style of their internal platform with the black and the grey tone. Also, they wished to keep the graphics of the system icon simple with a single colour and thus the red colour on their corporate logo was used as the colour of the system icons. The background is dimmed down when there is a pop-up window. This is my second UI design project, and I mainly followed the requests from Shiseido. I have learnt about the workflow of making a website and an online e-card system. I used Adobe Illustrator for this project, and I found that the drop shadow effect may consume most of the RAM memory. Therefore, I started to learn how to use Adobe Xd and applied it in the later projects to improve the RAM usage problem.
