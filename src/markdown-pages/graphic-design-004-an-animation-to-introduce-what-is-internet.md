This is a supplementary animation of a textbook to introduce the Internet to primary students. Web pages are compared to book pages, and websites are compared to books. URL is like the magic door in Doraemon which can bring us to anywhere we wished in the Internet world. Finally, there is a reminder to students to be aware of different harmful contents on the Internet.

I was responsible for the script writing, illustration and editing of this animation. The script was written with reference to the book content. Adobe Illustrator and After Effect were used during the production of the animation.
