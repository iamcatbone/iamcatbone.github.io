This is a supplementary mini-game of the textbook for primary students to practise typing. It was the editor’s idea to make Shaolin Kungfu as the theme of the game. She believed practice makes perfect that practising typing was similar to practising Kungfu. Therefore, a background like the back yard of the Shaolin Temple, where monks practise Kung fu,  is used. Furthermore, the main character, Ken, of the primary textbook is practising Kungfu at the centre. Whenever students type, Ken starts practising Kungfu with some motion.

The vocabulary to be typed is shown in large font size above Ken’s head to ensure students know what should be typed. The character Dr Lion located at the bottom right corner will say some encouraging quotes while students typing to encourage students. A keyboard and hints with red colour are shown to help the students to recognise the positions of the buttons. The score and the remaining time is shown at the top centre and top right corner respectively. After the game, score, statistics of speed and accuracy are revealed.

The game is coded by a programmer while I was responsible for the mechanics, UI and graphic design of the game.
