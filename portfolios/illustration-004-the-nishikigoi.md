Nishikigoi attracts me because they are of similar colour but with different pattern distributions making each of them looks a bit different, for example, they may both have an orange body but different fin colours.

They have inspired me that though different people may look a bit different， all of us are of the same species called “homo sapiens”. Furthermore, at the species level, we all look alike but each of us can live a different life as we wish to accomplish different goals.
