I like playing different mobile games and one of the games is Identity V. I have been playing the game for one year and have joined a telegram group of Identity V with many people who like to play this game. Also, Telegram allows its users to create their own sticker packs easily. This inspired me to create a set of Telegram stickers of Identity V Characters. I have observed the emoji/ expression that people use frequently and then made stickers with those expressions. I am glad that the people in the group are happy with the sticker pack.
