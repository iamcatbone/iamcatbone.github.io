This UI design was modified from a previous design provided by the developer team. In the original design, the “forgot?” and “language” buttons were all below the login button. I think the “login” button should be the most important button of this page and thus made the other two buttons smaller at more relevant positions. Also, I have used the same orange colour as that of the company logo for the theme colour to make the page looks more coherent.</p>\n<p>I was responsible for changing the theme colours of an existing app, and only the UI of the login page is re-designed by me in this project. Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator were used in making the UI design.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/ui-ux-design/ui-of-login-page-for-fsee-limited","title":"UI of Login Page for FSEE Limited","date":"November 2018","banner":"/ui-ux-design/006/banner.jpg","mediaType":"carousell-image","mediaSrc":null,"mediaSrcList":["/ui-ux-design/006/media/001.jpg","/ui-ux-design/006/media/002.jpg"],"mediaSrcSize":"small"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
