My role was to work on the visual design part.</p>\n<h2>UI Design</h2>\n<p>Shiseido wished us to use the red colour on their corporate logo and stick to the style of their internal platform with the black and the grey tone. Also, they wished to keep the graphics of the system icon simple with a single colour and thus the red colour on their corporate logo was used as the colour of the system icons. The background is dimmed down when there is a pop-up window. This is my second UI design project, and I mainly followed the requests from Shiseido. I have learnt about the workflow of making a website and an online e-card system. I used Adobe Illustrator for this project, and I found that the drop shadow effect may consume most of the RAM memory. Therefore, I started to learn how to use Adobe Xd and applied it in the later projects to improve the RAM usage problem.</p>\n<h2>GIF e-Card Design</h2>\n<p>Together with the e-card system, I was responsible for designing the gif e-card as well. Shiseido had requested for e-cards for a birthday, anniversary or all-purpose in Japanese style or using cosmetics as the theme.</p>\n<p>I was responsible for the graphic design and creation of motion graphics with the use of Adobe Illustrator and After Effects.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/ui-ux-design/shiseido-e-card-platform","title":"Shiseido E-card platform","date":"November 2018","banner":"/ui-ux-design/005/banner.jpg","mediaType":null,"mediaSrc":null,"mediaSrcList":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
