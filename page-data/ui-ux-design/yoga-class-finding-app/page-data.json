My mother enjoys doing Yoga, which inspired me to work on the UI of an app to find Yoga classes.</p>\n<p>There is a star button for users to mark classes they are interested in but have not decided to join yet so that they can consider the classes later easily. Special features, the selling points, of the classes are listed in the detailed description to attract the users. Some people may find going to exercise/ Yoga class alone boring. Their friends who had also joined the class is shown as an attraction to the users to join.</p>\n<p>Besides Adobe Xd, many people use the Sketch App as a UI design tool. The UI design of this project is created by the Sketch App. I have bought the Sketch App because I would like to learn and know more tools which might be useful for my career in my free time.</p>\n<h3>Youtube Video</h3>\n<div style=\"margin:0px auto; text-align:center;\">\n    <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IstWwDJNYl8\">\n        <img src=\"/ui-ux-design/003/youtube.jpg\" alt=\"Youtube Video\" width=\"60%\">\n    </a>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"path":"/ui-ux-design/yoga-class-finding-app","title":"Yoga Class Finding App","date":"January 2019","banner":"/ui-ux-design/003/banner.jpg","mediaType":"carousell-image","mediaSrc":null,"mediaSrcList":["/ui-ux-design/003/media/001.png","/ui-ux-design/003/media/002.png","/ui-ux-design/003/media/003.png","/ui-ux-design/003/media/004.png","/ui-ux-design/003/media/005.png"],"mediaSrcSize":"small"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
