My colleagues like drinking coffee and they always order Starbucks coffee, which inspired me to work on the UI of an app to order drinks.</p>\n<p>I designed the flow of ordering with reference to that of the Starbucks ordering app in Hong Kong. In the current Starbucks app, the products are categorized into ‘beverage’ and ‘food’ and the drinks were in groups of ‘cold coffee’, ‘hot coffee’ etc. Since I would like to work on a drink ordering app, I removed the ‘food’ category and put drinks into ‘hot drinks’ and ‘cold drinks’ groups.</p>\n<p>In the Starbuck app, the users have to pass through the description page of the drink. It will be useful for first-time-customers but frequent customers may find that page unnecessary. Therefore, I put it in the ‘details’ so that users can look for more information whenever they want.</p>\n<p>I understand that price is crucial when making a purchase decision, thus, I added a snack bar at the bottom to tell users how much their beverage will cost according to their chosen options.</p>\n<h3>Youtube Video</h3>\n<div style=\"margin:0px auto; text-align:center;\">\n    <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2XzTIiyTGw\">\n        <img src=\"/ui-ux-design/004/youtube.jpg\" alt=\"Youtube Video\" width=\"60%\">\n    </a>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"path":"/ui-ux-design/a-drinking-ordering-app","title":"A Drink Ordering App","date":"January 2019","banner":"/ui-ux-design/004/banner.jpg","mediaType":"carousell-image","mediaSrc":null,"mediaSrcList":["/ui-ux-design/004/media/001.png","/ui-ux-design/004/media/002.png","/ui-ux-design/004/media/003.png","/ui-ux-design/004/media/004.png","/ui-ux-design/004/media/005.png","/ui-ux-design/004/media/006.png","/ui-ux-design/004/media/007.png","/ui-ux-design/004/media/008.png","/ui-ux-design/004/media/009.png"],"mediaSrcSize":"small"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
