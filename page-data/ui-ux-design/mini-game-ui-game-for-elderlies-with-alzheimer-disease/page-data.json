Due to the disease, their short term memory decline over time. It is known that keep training their brain can somehow slow down the process. On the other hand, many elderlies pet cats at their home, and thus, I think they will find a game with cats as the theme familiar. That’s why I had an idea of making this game.</p>\n<p>When playing the game, the cats with different cushion colours will be shown for some time (eg 30 seconds). After that, they have to match the cushions with the cats to train up their short-term memory. There will be several rounds and the number of cats will increase by one after each round.</p>\n<p>Since I do not have the programming skills, this game is not completed. I have thought of the mechanics and completed the graphic design of the game. I worked on the UI design with reference to an app, Brainastic, that is developed for brain training as well.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/ui-ux-design/mini-game-ui-game-for-elderlies-with-alzheimer-disease","title":"Mini-Game UI: Game for Elderlies with Alzheimer's Disease","date":"August 2017","banner":"/ui-ux-design/009/banner.jpg","mediaType":"carousell-image","mediaSrc":null,"mediaSrcList":["/ui-ux-design/009/media/001.png","/ui-ux-design/009/media/002.png","/ui-ux-design/009/media/003.png"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
