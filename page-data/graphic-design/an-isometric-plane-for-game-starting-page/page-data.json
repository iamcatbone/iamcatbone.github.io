I had never worked on an isometric design. Thus, I made an isometric plane as the starting page of a game in my spare time.</p>\n<p>It is not produced as a game. In my imagination, it would be a game to jump over different obstacles. The player can choose to use different animals with different skills, for example, the hen can lay eggs that are explosive to destroy the obstacles with a cool down period. After accomplishing some achievements, new animals will be unlocked and may be different maps, skins and skills of higher levels will be unlocked.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/graphic-design/an-isometric-plane-for-game-starting-page","title":"An Isometric Plane for Game Starting Page","date":"November 2018","banner":null,"mediaType":"single-image","mediaSrc":"/graphic-design/002/media.png","mediaSrcList":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
