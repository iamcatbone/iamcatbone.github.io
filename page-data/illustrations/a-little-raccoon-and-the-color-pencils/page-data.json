It seems that with paper and colour pencils, we can find magic. At the same time, the little raccoon holds its hands firmly on the paper. The message behind this illustration is that doing art/ design is the only thing glowing in my heart, like how it is in my heart when I was young, even after I have grown up. Most importantly, I am not going to give up no matter what.</p>\n<p>I chose raccoon to represent me because of the character Rocket in Guardian of the Galaxy. Rocket is a brave character who speaks whatever he thinks and do whatever he likes. Thus, I wish to be like Rocket. As we grow up, there are more and more unsaid limitations and constraints that we may hide the ‘true me’. In Hong Kong, the social status of designers and artists are low and they are low paid. Parents do not wish their children to be a designer or artist. However, as time passed by, I truly understand that I really enjoy working in the creative industry and would like to be a designer in the future.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/illustrations/a-little-raccoon-and-the-color-pencils","title":"Business Card Design","date":"September 2018","banner":null,"mediaType":"single-image","mediaSrc":"/illustrations/002/media.png","mediaSrcList":null,"mediaSrcSize":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
